### RULES
use best devlopement standards
its an open book test but you have to stay within the time limit (in the real world your gonna use google for things you dont know)
using only the packages I provided in this project, complete the following within 1 hour 
1) build a bare bones counter the uglier the better using react
2) using fetch await syntax, fetch data from the api listed in app.js
3) display the raw JSON on the dom
4) display the first name last name & gender from the JSON on the dom
5) using the second url I provided in app.js, make it so that I can click a button & paginate forwards & backwards between random users
